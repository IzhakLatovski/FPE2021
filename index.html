        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          An Innovative project that looks at the unspoken aspect of The
          Holocaust - the female perpetrators - through a Travelling exhibition.
          It is time we acknowledge the females who were involved in the
          atrocities. The exhibit shows who these women were and what they did
          to be able to develop and create a deeper understanding of The
          Holocaust and its perpetrators. It also equalizes the gendered view of
          The Holocaust. The question of "Ordinary People" and the making of
          mass murderers is presented by shocking examples that provokes the
          visitors' thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhibit will be presented in Museums, memorial sites, educational
          and cultural centers, schools, universities, and colleges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhibit itself is portable, easily maneuvered and easily built.
          The content will invent engagement of the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academics from different areas across the world are presenting their
          views in short clips.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhibition emphasizes educational aspects for various visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It accompanied by an interactive App/Website to expand on select
          topics.

              Lives in Qiryat ata, Israel. Studying BA in Criminology at Western
              Galilee Collage. The Holocaust is very important to me as my great
              grandparents were veterans from World War Two and fought against
              the Nazis. I know they would like me to perpetuate the memory of
              what occurred and to make sure that the next generation understand
              what happened. I chose this project because I am interested to
              understand how people managed to commit such heinous crimes
              without previously being horrendous criminals.

              Lives in Ramot Menashe, Israel. Holds a PhD in Jewish History with
              a special focus on the Holocaust. Teaches on The Holocaust Studies
              Program at Western Galilee College in Akko, Israel. Currently
              conducting a post-doctorate at Bar Ilan University. "I was always
              interested in learning about The Holocaust and decided to devote
              myself to researching this topic and share it with my students. As
              a 'third-generation' Holocaust survivor it is my mission to
              continue exploring what happened during this horrible time".

              Lives in Kefar Yassif, Israel. Studying BA in Education at Western
              Galilee College. "I chose to learn about the Holocaust from when I
              studied it in high school, in Brazil. I continued my studies on
              the subject in College and received a distinction in my Holocaust
              studies. My goal is to expand my knowledge about this topic and
              share this valuable knowledge to the world. Every human being
              should know about what happened during the Holocaust".

              Lives in Carterton, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Studying BA
              Honours in History at The University of Winchester. My research
              focuses on the female perpetrators of The Holocaust, I feel it is
              necessary to acknowledge all the perpetrators that committed war
              crimes within The Holocaust, so we can understand as different
              societies that gender does not influence the way we treat others.
              The Holocaust as a topic has been widely researched to understand
              why people acted in the ways they did, yet the female involvement
              has been somewhat ignored and to be able to fully understand The
              Holocaust for further generations is to acknowledge all those
              involved.
